  /* sage-navy as base for cinematic feel, or slate-50 if light mode desired. User asked for premium depth. Let's go with a very dark slate or keep light but high quality. User's previous code was slate-50. User asked for "Premium, Layered, Immersive". Often dark is "cinematic". But "Apple/Stripe" are often light/airy. Let's check the user request again. "Dark cinematic gradient background" for CTA. "Premium deep navy gradient" for Footer. "Hero... Full-screen immersive...". Let's stick to a rich light theme with dark cinematic sections, or a dark theme. Apple uses a lot of light, Stripe too. But "Cinematic" usually implies dark.
  Wait, "SageAlpha" typically uses a lot of white/blue. I will stick to a very high quality light theme with dark sections (CTA, Footer) and maybe toggle capability later. Or, I can make the whole site "Dark Mode" if it feels more premium.
  Let's look at "Hero Section Transformation": "Gradient text with subtle animated shimmer", "Floating architectural card... glassmorphism".
  Actually, let's keep the `slate-50` light theme base but make it cleaner, and execute the "cinematic" parts via the specific section designs (Hero can be light or dark, CTA is dark).
  However, "Apple-level premium" often means very stark white/gray or very deep black.
  I will use `white` background to start, but allow sections to override. Use `antialiased`. */
